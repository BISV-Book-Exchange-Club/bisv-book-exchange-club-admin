<p>The Book Exchange was started in Summer, 2017, after BISV student Dennis Woo read an article in the newspaper about struggling schools in the Alum Rock School District.  At the same time, Dennis had listened to his mother grouse about the difficulties in exchanging school books with other parents, and the idea was born for the Book Exchange.
</p>
<p>The Book Exchange is a clearinghouse for used school books.  Families drop off books that they wish to sell at the end of the school year.  The books are catalogued and sorted, then sold throughout the summer and at the beginning of the school year.  For each book sold, the Book Exchange collects a small transaction fee, which is used to purchase school supplies for Cesar Chavez Elementary and Lee Mathson Middle School in the Alum Rock School District.
</p>
<p>Each student who has run the Book Exchange has put their own imprint on the process.  
</p>
<p>Summer 2017 -- The initial Book Exchange was small and raised approximately $400.  However, Dennis realized that there were some particularly fantastic end-of-summer paper deals at Staples and after checking in with the principals at both schools to confirm storage space, decided to spend the majority of the money raised buying ~1000 pounds of copy paper, allowing the principals to spend their budget on other needed items.
</p>
<p>Summer 2018 -- The second Book Exchange was more organized and raised roughly double the previous year's amount.  Dennis Woo focused more on working with the school and developing more automated methods of buying and selling school books.  With the absence of copy paper deals, the students focused more on traditional back to school supplies, purchasing in bulk during the Back-to-School sales.
</p>
<p>Summer 2019 -- With Dennis Woo graduated from BISV, leadership was passed to a trio: Katherine Woo, Alan Liu,  and Anaiy Somalwar.  Katherine Woo worked with BISV administration to sell unwanted textbooks on EBay, as well as handling day to day sales throughout the summer and serving as the contact with the principals of Cesar Chavez Elementary and Mathson Middle.  Alan Liu, along with his brother Ethan, handled book intake, pricing, as well as explored ideas on how to improve the process such as building a website for promotion and automating book process via R programming. Anaiy Somalwar experimented with methods of better automating the book pricing using Java programming as well as negotiating with certain Staples stores for discounts.  All participated in the final Book Sale as well as the purchasing and delivering of school supplies.  Slightly more than $2000 was raised for donation.
</p>
<p>Summer 2020 -- With the pandemic interfering with public gatherings and school moving to online classrooms, the team is experimenting with different ways of raising money and collecting the books needed for sale.  The Basis Book Exchange has finished another successful year of raising money for Cesar Chavez Elementary and the Mathson Institute of Technology Middle School.  It was a tough year for the book exchange, because of the need for social distancing, but through the  efforts of the group (Katherine Woo, Alan Liu, Anaiy Somalwar, and Ethan Liu) and some creative ways for fundraising (such as promoting book sales through a web portal and school parents communities on WeChat and Telegram, selling books on eBay, and running a chess class), we were able to match the dollar amount raised last year -- $2400. The need for school supplies has never been greater.  The pandemic and resulting shutdown of businesses has disproportionately affected poorer neighborhoods, and the two schools have simultaneously faced additional expenses as they switch over to online learning including the need for tablets, hotspots, as well as additional IT support for teachers working online.  The Book Exchange was able to provide headphones for nearly every student at Cesar Chavez Elementary, which Principal Villalobos says is their greatest need.  For Mathson Middle, the Book Exchange was able to provide roughly 40% of the high quality notebooks needed by the students, which are turned into de-facto textbooks by the students. The need for social distancing also led to an insight for connecting BASIS students to volunteer their time and efforts with online learning. Anaiy Somalwar initiated and approached Principal Vince Iwasaki about starting an online tutoring club to help the students at Mathson with their English and Math skills.  Many thanks to the generous families who allowed us to sell their books, as well as the super-generous families who donated the proceeds of those sales to Book Exchange.  
</p>
<p>Summer 2021- Our Book Exchange members had been at work cataloguing and sorting books all summer long. The efforts did not go unnoticed however, as this year the team donated more than $10,500 worth of supplies to two schools in the Alum Rock Union School District: Cesar Chavez Elementary School and Renaissance Academy at Lee Mathson Middle School. These campuses received a whopping supply of 600 Back to School kits, 600 Personal Care Kits, 2,000+ notebooks, 500 headphones, 3,000 face masks, as well as white boards, crayons, highlighters, markers, glue sticks, erasers, pencils, pens and more than 20 gallons of hand sanitizer. The partnership between our Book Exchange and the Alum Rock Union School District is an incredibly important one. Over 90% of the students who attend some of these schools fall into a much lower socioeconomic bracket. They are eligible for free/reduced priced meals, many students don't have personal space at home for studying, and money for school supplies is often in shortage. 
</p>
<p>This school year saw some some exciting changes in The Book Exchange's operations. Anaiy Somalwar, class of '22, who has been actively involved with the Book Exchange program over the last four years said, "This year was super special as we expanded to the BASIS Independent Fremont campus, and improved our online platform for managing inventory. We dipped into innovative avenues of fundraising and book donations. Mr. Roland Flores, General Manager of the Staples store in Campbell, not only helped with the excellent discounts, but also donated three truckloads of new school supplies. I personally ran a chess camp with younger students, and donated all proceeds to our campaign. Principals of both of the recipient schools, Dr. Julio Villalobos and Vince Iwasaki have always been very supportive of our efforts, and we are fortunate to play a small role in their student communities." Ethan L., class of '24, and Ian Y., class of '25, handled the majority of book intake, pricing, cataloguing books, and managing the sales over the summer. Ethan L. was also the technical person to make updates to the web portal for daily book inventory refresh to facilitate online transactions. Mithil P., class of '25, led the collection and payment of funds for the buyers and sellers, as well as sold books on Ebay to increase profits for the cause. Atharv D., class of '25 at BASIS Independent Fremont, helped to expand the program to a second campus. It was a big year for The Book Exchange; one that was clearly worth all the effort based on the sheer amount of supplies we were able to donate.
